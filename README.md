# Data-Bottles-
Wifi data throughput sonification using ntop, Fritzbox, computer fans and some plastic bottles. RPi is connected to Fritz!Box router, and capturing packets through running fritzdump.sh and spawning ntopng for analyzing the network traffic by reading traffic from a pipe. Arduino is listening to throughput values being captured and using them to drive fans which are making slits in plastic bottles resonate to sonify the flow of data!
